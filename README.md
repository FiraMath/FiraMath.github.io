## Usage

Fira Math can be used in LaTeX or Microsoft Word after installed on your OS.

### LaTeX

```latex
% Compiled with XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage[mathrm=sym]{unicode-math}
\setmathfont{Fira Math}

\begin{document}
\[
  \int_0^{\mathrm{\pi}} \sin x \, \mathrm{d}x = 2
\]
\end{document}
```

You may try the [`firamath-otf`](https://ctan.org/pkg/firamath-otf) package as well. - Thanks [Herbert Vo√ü](https://github.com/hvoss49)!

### Microsoft Word

1. Create a new equation. Then select the little *additional settings* corner.

1. In the menu, change the *Default font* to Fira Math.

1. In order for the changes to take effect, you will have to create a new equation environment (the current one will not be changed).

1. To change the font in existing equations, select the equation text and select an OpenType math-enabled font (such as Fira Math).
